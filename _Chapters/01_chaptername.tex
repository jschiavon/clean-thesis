Here is a reference to \cref{ch:second}. And here is a reference to \cref{sec:one-one} and then at \cref{sub:one-one-one}. And finally a reference to \cref{sec:two-one}.

Moreover, we can reference also \cref{thm:important} or \cref{eq:difficultmath} or even \crefrange{eq:difficultmath}{eq:onehalf} or \cref{thm:important,thm:small,def:first}. \Cref{eq:difficultmath} appears at the beginning of a sentence, while we can add that \cref{sec:two-one} is at \cpageref{sec:two-one}.

This is the first reference to the \gls{key}, while the subsequent calls use the shortened version \gls{key}. If you need you can use make it plural: \glspl{key}. Sometimes you might want to refer to a mathematical symbol, such as \gls{sym:p}. You can also use symbols inside math equations, as seen in \eqref{eq:wavefunc}.

\begin{equation}
	\abs{\gls{sym:Psi}(x,t)}^2 = \gls{sym:Psi}^\ast(x,t) \gls{sym:Psi}(x,t) \label{eq:wavefunc}
\end{equation}

\section{First section}\label{sec:one-one}
Here is some difficult math
\begin{equation}\label{eq:difficultmath}
    e^{i\pi} = - 1,
\end{equation}
while here some inline math as well $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$.

Moreover, here follows some example of theorems and other maths environments.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:important}
    If something is boring and long, a computer can do it better than you.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    It is left for exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:small}
    This is a small lemma instead.
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary}\label{thm:corollary}
    And this a corollary
\end{corollary}
\begin{definition}\label{def:first}
    We define \emph{half} a number to be that number than, when doubled, returns the original number:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:onehalf}
        a = \frac{x}{2} \quad \text{iff} \quad 2a = x.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
