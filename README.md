# Clean-Thesis

This repository contains the template for my phd thesis, that I am sharing in the hope that it might be useful to someone.

To build the pdf file, it should be sufficient to run `make` from the root of the project, while `make clean` is also available to remove all the auxiliary files.

Moreover, `make continuos` opens an instance of a pdf viewer and continuosly whatch the document to detect for saved changes in order to trigger a recompilation.
